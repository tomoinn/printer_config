# Printer Config

Config for my heavily customised printer. Originally a first generation Ender 3, the only remaining parts
are around 2/3 of the frame, the PSU, display, and housing for the motherboard.

Upgrades are:

* SKR E3Mini v3 mainboard
* Klipper on Pi 4, input shaping through KUSBA accelerometer
* Linear rails on X, Y, and Z axes from 3dFused, sensorless homing for X and Y axes
* Upgraded steppers from oozenest
* BLTouch probe
* Hemera direct drive extruder with 40W Revo nozzle / heater combo
* Dual Z axis, belt drive connecting matched custom Z mounts with ACME anti-backlash blocks
* Relocated spool holder, isolation mounts
* Rigid bed mounts
* Magnetic PEI build plate
* Bed insulation and cable relocation to drag chain
